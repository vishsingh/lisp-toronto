The official repository of the Toronto Lisp Users' Group (http://www.lisptoronto.org)
=====================================================================================

We will use this repository for any and all business relating to the Toronto Lisp Users' Group.

This includes:

- Code and slides from presentations given at meetings

- Code for projects we are currently working on

- Scraps of code you wish to share with the group

- etc.

If you are a member of the group and you've been to at least one meeting, contact me (vishvajitsingh@gmail.com) and I will add you as a collaborator.

Our long-term goal with this repository is to create interesting and useful open source projects, in order to make some contribution, however small, to the worldwide Lisp community.
