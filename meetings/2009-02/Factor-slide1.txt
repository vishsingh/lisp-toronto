                                         -------------------

The basic idea of FORTH:

Prefix:     f(x, y, z) = + x * y z                                  (defun f (x y z)
                                                                        (+ x (* y z)))

Infix:      f(x, y, z) = x + y * z


Postfix:    f(x, y, z) = x y z * +


And in FORTH..

: f * + ;

DEFINE the word f as the concatenation of the two words * and +.

We assume the user has put x, y, and z on the stack before calling f.
The effect of f is to remove x, y, and z, and leave only the result of the computation.
